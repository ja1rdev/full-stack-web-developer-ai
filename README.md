## 📚 Basic Concepts

### Programming Fundamentals

#### 🔄 Refactoring
> Changing the internal structure of code without altering external behavior.

#### 📦 Variables
> Containers that store information in the computer's RAM memory.

- **Undefined**: Variable created but not assigned a value
- **Naming conventions**:
  - `UpperCamelCase` - For classes
  - `camelCase` - For functions and variables
  - `snake_case` - For constants or some configurations

#### 🧩 Data Types

| Primitives (Direct assignment) | Referential (Point to memory) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ▪️ Number                       | ▪️ Arrays                         |
| ▪️ String                       | ▪️ Object                         |
| ▪️ Boolean                      | ▪️ Functions                      |
| ▪️ Undefined                    | ▪️ Classes                        |
| ▪️ Null                         |                                  |

#### 🔄 Dynamic Typing
> The type of a variable is automatically determined at runtime.

- `typeof` - Operator that returns the data type of a variable
